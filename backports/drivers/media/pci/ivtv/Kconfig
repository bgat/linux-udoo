	  This is a video4linux driver for Conexant cx23416 or cx23415 based
	  PCI personal video recorder devices.

	  This is used in devices such as the Hauppauge PVR-150/250/350/500
	  cards. There is a driver homepage at <http://www.ivtvdriver.org>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ivtv.

	  This driver provides an ALSA interface as another method for user
	  applications to obtain PCM audio data from Conexant cx23415/cx23416
	  based PCI TV cards supported by the ivtv driver.

	  The ALSA interface has much wider use in user applications performing
	  PCM audio capture, than the V4L2 "/dev/video24" PCM audio interface
	  provided by the main ivtv driver.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ivtv-alsa.
