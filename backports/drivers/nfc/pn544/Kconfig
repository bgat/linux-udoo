	  NXP PN544 core driver.
	  This is a driver based on the HCI BACKPORT_NFC kernel layers and
	  will thus not work with NXP libnfc library.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose m here. The module will
	  be called pn544.
	  Say N if unsure.

	  This module adds support for the NXP pn544 i2c interface.
	  Select this if your platform is using the i2c bus.

	  If you choose to build a module, it'll be called pn544_i2c.
	  Say N if unsure.

	  This module adds support for the mei interface of adapters using
	  NXP pn544 chipsets.  Select this if your pn544 chipset
	  is handled by Intel's Management Engine Interface on your platform.

	  If you choose to build a module, it'll be called pn544_mei.
	  Say N if unsure.
