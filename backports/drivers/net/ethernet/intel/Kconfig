config BACKPORT_NET_VENDOR_INTEL
	bool "Intel devices"
	depends on !NET_VENDOR_INTEL
	default y
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Intel cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

	  To verify that your adapter is supported, find the board ID number
	  on the adapter. Look for a label that has a barcode and a number
	  in the format 123456-001 (six digits hyphen three digits).

	  Use the above information and the Adapter & Driver ID Guide at:

	  <http://support.intel.com/support/network/adapter/pro100/21397.htm>
