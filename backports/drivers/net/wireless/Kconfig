        chips. This driver supports standard Linux wireless extensions.

        Many  cards based on this chipset do not have flash memory
        and need their firmware loaded at start-up. If yours is
        one of these, you will need to provide a firmware image

	  This is the standard Linux driver to support Cisco/Aironet PCMCIA
	  802.11 wireless cards.  This driver is the same as the Aironet
	  driver part of the Linux Pcmcia package.
	  It supports the new 802.11b cards from Cisco (Cisco 34X, Cisco 35X
	  - with or without encryption) as well as card before the Cisco
	  acquisition (Aironet 4500, Aironet 4800, Aironet 4800B). It also
	  supports OEM of Cisco such as the DELL TrueMobile 4800 and Xircom
	  802.11b cards.

	  This driver support both the standard Linux Wireless Extensions
	  and Cisco proprietary API, so both the Linux Wireless Tools and the
	  Cisco Linux utilities can be used to configure the card.

	  This enables support for FullMAC PCI/Cardbus prism54 devices. This
	  driver is now deprecated in favor for the SoftMAC driver, p54pci.
	  p54pci supports FullMAC PCI/Cardbus devices as well.

	  For more information refer to the p54 wiki:

	  http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/p54

	  Note: You need a motherboard with DMA support to use any of these cards

	  When built as module you get the module prism54
